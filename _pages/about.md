I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href='https://www.nyu.edu/'>New York University</a>, advised by <a href='https://saiqianzhang.com/'>Prof. Sai Qian Zhang</a>. Prior to that, I received my B.S. from Peking University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yufei Ma. I also had the pleasure of working as a research intern at the Computer Systems Laboratory at Cornell University, under the supervision of Prof. Zhiru Zhang.

My research interests lie in machine learning, computer architecture, efficient AI, software/hardware co-design, and virtual reality (VR/AR).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
